# LineFollowingRobot
A line following robot programmed to follow a black line using infrared sensors and an Arduino Board. The robot uses an arduino board connected to two infrared sensors which act as input sources for the arduino. The two motors are connected to the arduino board using an L293D chip. Dependant on the input received from the sensors, the motors act accordingly in order to follow the black line which is being sensed by the sensors. The code for the arduino program is included in this repository, as well as a schematic for connecting the L293D chip to the motors and the arduino.
